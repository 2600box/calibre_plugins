## Overview

Users will often have books in their collection for which there is no official cover available to download, such as short fiction and articles. Calibre includes the ability to generate a cover for you from the book metadata. However currently the only control over its appearance it offers is a tweak for the font.

This plugin offers an enhanced alternative that allows you to select from your own choice of cover images and a wide range of layout/appearance options.

## Main Features

- Add/remove your own images to a list to choose from when you generate
- Option to use the existing book cover as an embedded image
- Control which metadata to display and where it is located on the cover
- Option to swap author name for users who store it in Calibre as LN, FN
- Fine tune many aspects of cover appearance such as fonts, borders, colors and margins
- Save your customised settings under a name to quickly recall multiple different appearances
- Export your settings for sharing and import settings from other users
- Option to use an image as a background rather than a content item
- Option to add custom text to a cover, using [Calibre's template language](http://manual.calibre-ebook.com/template_lang.html) to place your choice of additional data on the cover
- Option to auto-size text to fit on a single line for long text

## Configuration Options

| Option  |Description |
| ------| ----------- |
| Scan multiple editions for title/author searches | By default the first match from the Goodreads search is used.<br>Historically this edition was often an audiobook which may not contain ideal metadata.<br>Enabling this option will ensure audiobook editions are skipped, but will take longer to retrieve. |
