## Overview

This wizard-based plugin allows you to match existing or create empty books in calibre based on lists of books from external sources. For some users it may be they want to import an existing list of their own reading/books, for others it can be that they want to import lists of bestsellers, popular books, genre recommendations, award winners and so on. Once matched you can integrate with the [Reading List](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=134856) plugin to record as a list to read, send to a device or just view on screen.

- **Import from Clipboard** - paste in a list of book title/authors copied to your clipboard, such as from a website forum post of favourite books.
- **Import from CSV File** - many users have lists of books stored in applications like Excel which can export to CSV, or use websites like Goodreads/Library Thing which also have export to CSV capability.
- **Import from Web Page** - over 100 predefined websites are configured (including Goodreads, Amazon etc) or you can add your own. Included in the predefined websites is Fantastic Fiction, which can be an easy way to scrape title, author, series and pubdate metadata for all books by an author. Note that for this and any of the predefined websites that you are not limited to the specific URL configured. You can navigate to the website page of interest in your browser, then drag/drop or copy the URL into the Website tab of this plugin. most websites use the same layout for their webpages so no other configuration needs to be changed.
