## Overview

This plugin offers another download source for book metadata including some excellent quality covers by retrieving from [www.barnesandnoble.com](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/).

As with the [Goodreads](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=130638) plugin it is designed to either supplement or replace the metadata plugins that come with Calibre. Unlike the Goodreads plugin you cannot get any get any tags (genres) from this plugin as Barnes & Noble do not have any such information on a book detail page. If that changes in future I can look to support that.

However it does have higher quality covers available in larger sizes than many of the other metadata plugins offer, as well as series information like Goodreads.

## Main Features

- Can retrieve title, author, series, isbn, comments, rating, publisher, publication date and covers
- Also retrieves a barnes & noble id, which is really just a combination of isbn and book information that can be used to directly jump to the page for a specific book from the book details pane (like Goodreads/ISBN etc).
- Option to customise the number of ISBN editions to consider when doing title/author searches. Set this to 1 for maximum download speed, with a risk that the first edition chosen does not have a large cover available.
- Option to retrieve all contributors to a book as an author. By default this is turned off, however B&N is able to provide illustrators, editors etc should you want these retrieved.

## Configuration Options

| Option  | Description |
| --------| ----------- |
| Maximum title/author matches | Defaults to 1 meaning only first match if multiple will be compared.
| Get all authors | If unchecked, only the primary authors for this book are returned.
