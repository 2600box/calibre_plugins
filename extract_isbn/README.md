## Overview

This plugin can be used to try to find the ISBN for a book using the text within a book format. It is intended as an alternative to various script based solutions to this problem posted in [this thread](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=50691). 

## Main Features

- Scans all formats for the selected book(s) in preferred input format order until an ISBN-13 or ISBN-10 is found
- Runs as a background job in Calibre, prompting you to update when the scanning is completed.
- Scans only the book content, excluding HTML tag markup.
- For PDF formats, scans only the first 10 pages, then if ISBN not found, the last 5 pages in reverse order.
- For other formats, scans files at the front, then a number of end files in reverse order before the remainder of the book.
- Restricts valid ISBN-13s to those that start with 977, 978 or 979. You can add additional prefixes in the configuration if required.
- Optionally perform a search when completed showing you only the books updated (default is off). Some users may use this to then perform a metadata download.

## Configuration Options

| Option  | Description |
| --------| ----------- |
| When scan completes | **Do not change my search** - Default behavior of keeping calibre view unchanged.<br>**Show the books that have new or updated ISBNs** - Apply a search to show books this plugin changed. |
| Selected books before background job | Running as a background job keeps your UI more responsive.<br>By default if one book is selected, plugin runs immediately.<br>More than one book selected queues up as a calibre job instead.
| Batch size running as backkground job | When running in background, how many books to put in each job batch.|
