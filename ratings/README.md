## Overview

This plugin allows you to download the full precision rating count and number of reviewers from both Amazon and/or Goodreads. It does require you to have retrieved an amazon id and/or goodreads id for the book first, such as you may have by using the respective metadata plugins.

By default a calibre metadata download will not display the precision of the downloaded rating, displaying it as 0-5 stars. In addition it is not possible with metadata plugins to return data to calibre for additional columns of interest, such as the # of people who contributed to that rating score.

This limitation can be worked around by writing a UI plugin such as this, storing the data in your own custom columns you create. 

## Main Features

- Retrieve Amazon precise rating score and rating count into your custom columns.
- Retrieve Goodreads precise rating score and rating count into your custom columns.
- Optionally only retrieve Amazon or Goodreads rather than both.
- Preferences for configured columns are on a per library basis.
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts

## Configuration Options

| Option  | Description |

| Amazon Rating Count | Choose from dropdown list your calibre column to store the Amazon rating in.
