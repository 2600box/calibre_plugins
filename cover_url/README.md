## Overview

This plugin allows you to populate a custom column with the URL to a book cover image from goodreads.

I have a specific use case for this with a separate external tool which allows me to generate an HTML email of book summaries including cover images based on a calibre search. 

## Main Features

- Populate a cusrom column with the URL to the image for a book which has a goodreads identifier
- Configure the batch delay interval to work around anti-robot measures for multiple books.
